# Lecture

In this teaching talk, students will be introduced to the Conservation of Energy principle.
I will operate as if this is a real class, perhaps with some narrations breaking the fourth wall to explain some of my teaching decisions.
The class will be in a standard active learning format with some clicker questions done using Zoom stamps, and a few worksheet problems.
We will end with a super cool video that segues nicely into our next topic.
Talk attendees are welcome to attend in one of two modes: "active" or "passive".
Active participants will be those willing to engage in all aspects of the talk (including breakout rooms), while passive participants may opt-out of certain components of the talk.
Come as you are!
